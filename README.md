# Unit-4-Game
4th week homework game for UTA Boot Camp

I'm really proud of this game!

Like other crystal collector games, the goal of this game is to click a crystal, which is given a random value between 2 and 12, which adds that value to your total score. Get to the target score without going over, and you win!

My game uses a for loop for check whether or not any crystal values are repeated, and resets those values until they're all unique. Also, if all of the values are initially even, one of the crystals will immediately be reset to 3.

My game adds a "Hardcore Mode", which is selectable on initial the popup window, and which adds a 10-second timer. When the timer reaches 0, the crystal values reset, and the target an current scores stay the same! The player must therefore move extremely quickly the learn and use the initial values, or risk being smited by RNGsus.

I constructed this website layout using Bootstrap, and use JQuery throughout the game.js file.
